Disabling:
The following disables a GPU, making it invisible, so that it's not on the list of CUDA devices you can find (and it doesn't even take up a device index)

nvidia-smi -i 0000:xx:00.0 -pm 0
nvidia-smi drain -p 0000:xx:00.0 -m 1
where xx is the PCI device ID of your GPU. You can determine that using lspci | grep NVIDIA or nvidia-smi.

The device will still be visible with lspci after running the commands above.

Re-enabling:
nvidia-smi drain -p 0000:xx:00.0 -m 0
the device should now be visible

Problems with this approach
This may fail to work if you are not root; or in some scenarios I can't yet characterize.
Haven't yet checked what happens to procesess which are actively using the GPU as you do this.
The syntax is baroque and confusing. NVIDIA - for shame, you need to make it simpler to disable GPUs.
